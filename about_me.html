                        My name is Meredith Onions, and I am a junior studying informatics - which can be defined as computer science from more of a usability standpoint - at 
                        the University of Iowa. I love to learn, and I am very passionate about academics. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection between art and 
                        technology; I absolutely love to code and think through logical problems, and I also greatly enjoy visual design.

                    <p1 style="font-size: 16pt; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 30px;">
                        My goal is to have a career that involves innovating and solving problems in the world of technology. I am proficient in many programming languages such as 
                        Java and Python. As a part of my major, I have learned a lot about programming and HCI, and as a computer science minor, I have taken coursework such as 
                        Discrete Structures, Data Structures, and Algorithms. I developed this website myself to present a little more about me and my work.
