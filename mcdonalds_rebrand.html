                    As my final project for Graphic Design I in Fall 2024, I was assigned to rebrand McDonald’s. At first, I felt like this was a daunting task - McDonald’s 
                    has such a universal brand, and I was having a hard time picturing how I could possibly change it. However, I ended up really enjoying this project; it provided 
                    me with a good challenge to end my semester.
                </p1>
                <p class="" style="margin: 10px;"></p>
                <p1 style="font-size: 14pt; padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 30px;">
                    I began with thinking about memories of my family going to McDonald’s, and I realized that we often eat there while we are traveling. Because of these memories, 
                    I decided to go with a theme of travel and transportation for my rebrand. For the logo, I kept the idea of the letter M since it is so unanimous with McDonald’s. 
                    However, instead of the golden arches, my version of the logo is derived from an arrow - inspired by the arrows that one sees on highway road signs. Because of its 
                    simplicity, I used this logo for the front of the rebranded business card as well.
                </p1>
                <p class="" style="margin: 10px;"></p>
                <p1 style="font-size: 14pt; padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 30px;">
                    I went with a motif of red circles because they reminded me of Ronald McDonald’s clown nose, and I felt that it gave my rebrand a more youthful look. I also chose a 
                    more cartoonish, youthful looking font for my business card and menu; I felt that it appealed to children (a key demographic for McDonald’s) and it aligned with my 
                    theme of transportation. To further this theme, the yellow dashed border around the text in the menu is meant to represent the dashed line on a road. Finally, I kept 
                    the overall color scheme of red and yellow, as I felt it would make my rebrand more recognizable and familiar. 
                </p1>
                <p class="" style="margin: 10px;"></p>

                    I really enjoyed this project, and I am very proud of my final product.
